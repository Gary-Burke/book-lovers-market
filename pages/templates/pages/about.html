        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
            Every great story has a beginning—and ours started with a simple idea shared by a group of passionate
            readers. We all loved the feeling of standing in front of our bookshelves at home, taking in the colors, the
            titles, and the memories tied to each book. There's something deeply comforting about seeing your personal
            library neatly arranged in a cosy space, ready to be revisited at any moment.
        </p>
        <p>But one question kept coming back to us: What happens when we're away from home? What about those moments
            when you want to admire your collection, remember what you've read, or share your love of books while
            traveling, working, or simply out and about? That question sparked the beginning of Book Lovers Market and
            gave birth to the community you see today.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission grew from a desire to carry that same sense of satisfaction and fulfillment into the digital
            world. We wanted book lovers to be able to view, organize, and enjoy their personal libraries anytime,
            anywhere—no bookshelf required.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the idea evolved, another thought naturally followed: wouldn't it be wonderful if this space also allowed
            book lovers to connect with one another? A place where stories could continue their journey by being bought,
            sold, and shared within a like-minded community. A place where less-loved titles could find new homes and
            new readers.
        </p>
        <p>And so, our mission became clear. Book Lovers Market exists to help readers digitize their personal libraries
            while also creating a welcoming marketplace where book lovers can buy and sell books with ease. We are here
            to celebrate stories, encourage sharing, and spread the joy that only books can bring.</p>
        <p>We can't buy happiness but we can buy books and since books bring us happiness, it is essentially the same thing. So start buying your happiness today!</p>
